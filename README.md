# Steps


The purpose of this app is to help not only musicians but anyone who wants to develop and train their ears in order to be able to identify different musical intervals.

Steps is orginally developed for music therapy students to help train their ears in an entertaining and fun way.

This app will enable people to show case their ear training skills by playing a game against themselves or others, hone their ear training by being able to listen to what each interval sounds like, and compose different intervals on a piano.

## Behind the App

This was the first prototype of our musical interval app for a team project. We ended up remaking the app due to the realization that we could not accomplish what we had in mind with the current skills we had by the due date.
